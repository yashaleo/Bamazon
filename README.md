# Bamazon

Bamazon is completely original idea and not at all a complete ripff of Amazon...
The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory using Node.js and mySQL.

You need to first open up your terminal and enter node bamazonCustomer.js into your command line.

The app will display all it items listed for sale.
- They will show
  - id of item
  - name of item
  - price of item
  - stock quanity of item

You will be asked what is the item number you want to buy and how many of them. 
If it is avaible you will be told the total price in green.

The stock quanity will go down.

If you want to ask for a certain amount of items that is not avaible you will be told so in red and the stock quanity will not be changed.
